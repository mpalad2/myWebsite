            <h1>Hi, I'm Milan!</h1>
            <p>I'm a college graduate with a Bachelor's in Computer Science.
                <br>
                <br>
                I started having an interest in coding after trying out AP Computer Science A
                during my sophomore year of high school. I had an amazing teacher at the time, Mrs. Whitlock, who
                was very enthusiastic about teaching Java to her students. While I had struggled to get the hang of
                coding at first, I found that I actually liked the challenge and how satisfying it felt to finally solve
                the problems and errors in the code.
                <br>
                <br>
                The summer after my sophomore year, I applied and interned at CareerBuilder, which had a Girls In Tech
                Program at the time that aimed to help more women enter the tech field. A fellow intern and I helped
                create a website for the Project Integrity team, learning introductory Ruby on Rails, HTML,
                and CSS along the way.
                <br>
                <br>
                It was interesting to work and code for the summer, and I had met a lot of fun and helpful
                colleagues during that time, too! I had decided since then that I would pursue computer science as a
                career path. So far I've dabbled in other programming languages such as Python, Javascript, PHP, and C#.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                While I do like to code, I also have a vested interest in art. I took up art as a hobby around
                eighth grade, doodling and creating original characters on loose pieces of paper. I actually used part
                of the money I earned from the CareerBuilder internship to buy myself a drawing tablet, and I've been a
                practicing digital artist ever since. In my spare time, I participate in fanzines and passion projects.</p>
