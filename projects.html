            <h2>Cornucopia</h2>
            <h4>Cornucopia is a dating sim in which the player finds themselves transported to a completely different
                world. And they couldn’t have come at a worse time - the kingdom of Cornucopia has entered a new age of
                ruling between locusts and corns, but tensions are high. It is up to the player and their new Cornucopian
                allies to bring peace to the world. The player must forge new bonds and adapt quickly to their new
                environment if they ever hope to return to their world!</h4>
            <p>This demo was created using Ren'py, which is written using Python. Players can choose unique
                dialogue and actions in each scene. I worked as the programmer as well as
                a character designer for several of the different suitors.
                <br>
                <br>
                The demo is free to download on <a href="https://mpalad2.itch.io/cornucopia">Itch.io</a>!

            <h2>PerPETuity: True Bonds</h2>
            <h4>PerPETuity:True Bonds is a top down pixel rpg game in which the player must fight their way through
                the sewers of the mighty Crocochip to escape and find their owner!</h4>
            <p>This demo was created in Unity using C# programming. Players can move and shoot enemy crocodiles, as well
                as interact with the environment to pick up and receive items and stat boosts.
                I worked as the lead programmer, creating the base of the game scripts.
                I also worked as an artist for the dog and merchant animations along with some background assets.

            <h2>Bee On Time</h2>
            <h4>Bee On Time is a mobile app where you can create checklists, reminders, and timers and set your mood for
                    each day. You can also receive positive encouragement to complete tasks.</h4>
            <p>This application was created on Android Studio with the use of Java.
                I worked on the mood chart that allows the user to set how their overall mood was for the day. This part
                of the application allows the user to keep track of how their mood fluctuates throughout the full month.</p>
